# Koan

Capture the "how do we do X" know-how that lives in people's heads, turn it into
reusable playbooks, and recall it later — from inside Claude. Local-first: your
knowledge lives in plain markdown files on your own machine.

Built for law firms (confidentiality and ethical-wall aware), but the core is
domain-agnostic.

> **Koan ships as a skills-only Claude plugin** (built for **Cowork**). The nine
> skills read and write your knowledge as plain markdown files using Claude's own
> file tools — **no server, no database, no API key, nothing to build.** Install
> the `plugin/` folder and you're done. An optional local MCP server (in this
> repo) adds vector-based semantic search for very large knowledge bases; most
> firms won't need it — see [Optional: the MCP server](#optional-the-mcp-server).

## How it fits together

```
   Claude (Cowork)
   ├─ skills (plugin/)  ── the capture → review → recall → deploy workflows
   └─ file tools        ── read / write / search plain markdown
                  ▼
       ~/Documents/firm-knowledge/   (INDEX.md · inbox/ · units/ · archive/ · docs/)
```

Claude runs the interview, structures the knowledge, and reads/writes the files
directly. Everything stays on your machine; nothing leaves your computer and no
model is called beyond the Claude you're already talking to.

## The knowledge lifecycle

1. **Capture** — the `capture` skill runs a short debrief and Claude structures
   your answers into a unit — or, right after a task ("capture what we just
   did"), distills the unit from the work already done in the conversation
   instead of interviewing you. The `ingest` skill is the document-shaped
   entrance: it stores an existing document's text in `docs/` and can extract
   the procedures it describes as drafts into the same queue.
2. **Structure** — Claude writes the unit as a **draft** markdown file to
   `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/inbox/`.
3. **Serve** — the `recall` skill searches your files (titles + content) and
   answers from the firm's own units, attributed to the source. Every hit is
   logged to `usage.md` (which knowledge actually earns its keep); when it
   can't answer, it logs the question to `gaps.md` — demand-side evidence of
   what the firm should capture next, which `landscape` and `map` surface.
4. **Maintain** — every unit is written `status: draft` and is never treated as
   authoritative until a human reviews it and **promotes** it (via the `review`
   skill) to `units/`, stamping `verified_by`, `verified_on`, and a `review_by`
   date. Promotion drops the `draft-` id prefix and flips `status` to `active`;
   drafts can also be edited or discarded. When a promoted unit's `review_by`
   date passes, `review` surfaces it again for re-vouching, updating, or
   retiring — so vouched knowledge doesn't silently go stale. Retired units
   move to `archive/` (`status: retired`), never the trash: the record of what
   the procedure *used to be* stays available; only unpromoted drafts are ever
   deleted.
5. **Improve** — the `improve` skill asks the question `capture` deliberately
   doesn't: *is this a good process?* It critiques a promoted unit — grounded
   in the logged friction, gaps, and usage before general opinion — and, on
   your say-so, writes the proposed revision as a new draft that `supersedes`
   the original. The proposal goes through the same review gate as everything
   else; when a human promotes it, the original is retired to `archive/` with
   the supersession trail intact. The faithful record and the better process
   both survive.
6. **Deploy** — a promoted unit can be turned into a *runnable* workflow, not just
   a retrievable one: the `scaffold` skill maps a unit's steps, exceptions, and
   authorities into a generated `SKILL.md`, installed for one user or into the
   shared **firm plugin** (`firm-knowledge/firm-plugin/` — one artifact the
   whole team installs). Capture knowledge, then deploy the parts worth running.
   Each generated skill is a snapshot stamped with a `koan_source` fingerprint
   (the unit's `verified_on`) and tracked in
   `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/skills/.scaffold-manifest.json`; `scaffold --check`
   detects skills whose source unit was re-promoted and regenerates them, so
   deployed workflows track *vouched* changes. And deployed skills report back:
   when a run hits a situation the steps didn't cover, it's logged to
   `friction.md` — field evidence `improve` and `landscape` feed on, closing
   the loop.

Confidentiality is a first-class field (`internal | walled | client`); flag
`walled` when a capture references a specific client matter.

## Installation

### Add from GitHub (Claude app — recommended)

Koan ships a plugin marketplace at the root of this repo, so you can install it
straight from GitHub — no download, no zip, no build.

1. In the **Claude app**, open the plugin / marketplace manager and choose **Add
   marketplace**.
2. Paste the repo:

   ```
   samharden/koan
   ```

   (or the full URL `https://github.com/samharden/koan`)
3. Claude reads the marketplace, lists the **koan** plugin — click **Install**,
   then restart the app if prompted.

That's it: the nine skills are ready, and your first capture creates the
knowledge folder at `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/`. To update later, re-open the
marketplace entry and pull the latest version.

> The marketplace manifest lives at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
> and points at the [`plugin/`](plugin/) folder, so "Add marketplace →
> `samharden/koan`" always installs the current plugin from `main`.

### Install the plugin from a `.zip` (Cowork)

In **Cowork / Claude Desktop**, upload the plugin via the in-app plugin manager,
then restart the app. Done — no Node, no terminal, no build, no config files, no
connector. The nine skills are ready, and your first capture creates the
knowledge folder at `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/`.

> Why this is all you need: in Cowork, Claude has file tools, so the skills read
> and write your knowledge as plain markdown directly. There's nothing to run in
> the background and nothing that reaches the network — which also means **no
> "this extension can access your computer" install warning** to worry your users.

#### Build the install `.zip`

The plugin manager takes a single `.zip`. The one rule that matters: the plugin
manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) must sit at the **root of the zip** — not
nested inside a `plugin/` folder. Zipping the *contents* of `plugin/` (not the
folder itself) is what gets that right.

**Easiest — one command** (from the repo root):

```bash
npm run pack:plugin      # writes koan-plugin.zip with the correct structure
```

**By hand — macOS / Linux terminal:**

```bash
cd plugin
zip -r ../koan-plugin.zip . -x '*.DS_Store'   # zip the contents, not the folder
```

> ⚠️ Don't right-click the `plugin` folder in Finder → **Compress**. That nests
> everything under `plugin/` in the archive, so the manifest ends up at
> `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the plugin manager won't find it.

**Verify** the structure before uploading — the manifest should be at the top:

```bash
unzip -l koan-plugin.zip | grep plugin.json
#   307  ...  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      ✅ at the root
#   307  ...  plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json   ❌ nested — re-zip the contents
```

Then upload `koan-plugin.zip` in the plugin manager and restart the app.

The skills (`plugin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) trigger on natural phrasing or
explicitly as `/koan:intro`, `…:capture`, `…:ingest`, `…:recall`, `…:review`,
`…:landscape`, `…:map`, `…:improve`, `…:scaffold`. See [plugin/README.md](plugin/README.md)
for the per-skill table and the on-disk layout.

**Claude Code CLI** (optional): `claude plugin marketplace add samharden/koan`
(or a local `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/koan`) then `claude plugin install koan@koan`,
and `/reload-plugins`. Or `npm run install-skills` to symlink the skills into
`~/.claude/skills` directly.

---

### Optional: the MCP server

You only need this if you want **vector-based semantic search** over a very large
knowledge base (thousands of units) instead of Claude reading the files directly —
or if you're on a surface without file tools (classic Claude Desktop chat). Most
firms can skip it; the skills work fully without it.

The repo still contains the local MCP server (`apps/mcp`, built on `@koan/core`)
and two ways to install it:

- **`npm run setup`** — builds the server and registers it as a Claude Code CLI
  connector (`claude mcp add`, user scope), reading `KOAN_HOME` from `$KOAN_HOME`,
  your Cowork/Desktop config, or the default.
- **`npm run pack:mcpb`** — builds `koan.mcpb`, a double-click Desktop Extension
  that bundles the connector + the local embedding engine. (Built/validated on
  macOS.)

If you run the MCP server, point its `KOAN_HOME` at the **same folder** the skills
use (`~/Documents/firm-knowledge`) so both see one store. The connector needs **no
API key** — Claude does all the structuring; the server is pure local storage +
retrieval.

## Try it

**Day one — start with what you already have.** The fastest way to a useful
knowledge base isn't an interview; it's the documents the firm already wrote:

> **You:** Here's our intake checklist and the memo on conflict screening — pull
> the procedures into the knowledge base.

The `ingest` skill stores each document's text and extracts the procedures it
describes as drafts — one afternoon of ingesting can seed a review queue that
would take months of interviews. Then run `/koan:landscape`: even over a handful
of units it diffs your coverage against practice-area baselines and hands back a
capture roadmap, so you know what to capture next instead of guessing.

**Day to day — capture is a byproduct of work.** Right after Claude helps you
through a real task, say:

> **You:** Capture what we just did so the next person doesn't start from scratch.

The `capture` skill distills the draft from the conversation itself — the steps
actually taken, the traps actually hit — and asks only the two or three
questions the transcript can't answer. No interview.

**The full loop** — capture something, review it, recall it — in three chats:

**1. Capture.** Tell Claude you want to write something down:

> **You:** Let's document how we handle conflict waivers for lateral hires.

The `capture` skill runs a short interview (trigger → steps → traps → authorities
→ provenance), shows you the assembled draft to confirm, then writes it as a
markdown file to `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/inbox/` with `status: draft`.

**2. Review.** When you're ready to vouch for it:

> **You:** What's in the review queue?

The `review` skill lists pending drafts, opens each one (edit / promote /
discard), and on **promote** records *who* verified it and a next-review date. The
unit moves to `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/units/` and becomes `status: active` —
authoritative firm knowledge. Nothing is authoritative until a human does this.

**3. Recall.** Later, anyone asking how the firm does it gets the captured answer:

> **You:** How do we do conflict waivers when we bring on a lateral?

The `recall` skill searches your files **first** and answers from your own
units — citing which unit it drew from, flagging anything still in draft, and
respecting `walled` / `client` confidentiality — instead of generic advice. If
nothing matches, it says so and offers to capture it.

## How recall finds things

Recall reads `INDEX.md` first — a maintained table of contents with one line per
unit (title, practice areas, trigger hook), so a single read usually identifies
the right unit — then reads the matching files in full, falling back to listing
and grepping `units/` and `inbox/` when the index misses. The writing skills
keep the index current and `review` rebuilds it if it drifts; the folders are
always the truth. At a firm's scale (tens to hundreds of procedures) that's fast
and accurate.

For a **much** larger corpus you can add the optional MCP server, which builds a
local vector index for semantic ranking — embeddings run on-device via
`@xenova/transformers` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), cached after first use, nothing sent to
a vector service. See [Optional: the MCP server](#optional-the-mcp-server).

## Sharing across the firm

Institutional knowledge is for other people, so put the knowledge folder
somewhere shared — a synced drive (Dropbox / OneDrive / a file share) or a git
repo everyone pulls — and have each person tell Claude the shared path. The loop
then works across roles: an associate captures, a partner promotes, everyone
recalls. Sync-conflict duplicates are just extra files (`review` resolves them
like any duplicate), and `verified_by` is a name, not a login — agree on full
names so promotions mean something. See
[plugin/README.md](plugin/README.md#sharing-across-the-firm) for details.

## Configuration

There's nothing to configure for the plugin. Your knowledge lives in one folder,
by default `~/Documents/firm-knowledge/` (`inbox/` · `units/` · `docs/`); tell
Claude if you want it somewhere else. `KOAN_HOME` only matters if you also run the
optional MCP server — point it at that same folder so both share one store.

No API key, ever — Claude does all the structuring.

## Security & status caveats

- **Your knowledge is plain files.** It's only as protected as the folder it lives
  in — back it up and control access like any sensitive firm directory. The skills
  never send it anywhere; everything stays on your machine.
- **Where data goes.** Nothing leaves your computer. No model is called beyond the
  Claude you're already talking to, and (in the plugin path) there's no network
  access at all.
- **Human-in-the-loop by design.** Captured units are `status: draft` and are not
  authoritative until a person promotes them. `owner` / `verified_by` are
  free-text — they record who vouched, they don't authenticate.
- **Ethical walls are advisory.** The `confidentiality` field (`walled` /
  `client`) controls how *Claude* treats a unit — it is not access control, and
  anyone who can open the folder can read the file. A real screen must be
  enforced where files are enforced: a separate folder or share with its own
  permissions.
- **Retired, not deleted.** Promoted knowledge is never destroyed — retiring a
  unit moves it to `archive/` with `status: retired`, preserving the record of
  what the procedure used to be. Only unpromoted drafts can be deleted.
- **Document ingest** reads the text layer only. Scanned-image PDFs yield no text;
  OCR is a future add.
